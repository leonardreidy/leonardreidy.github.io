# Developing Sound

Welcome to Developing Sound, the personal website of Leonard M Reidy. I am a
fullstack developer by day and a sound designer/electronic musician by night.
The site is, for now, a basic profile. It should include my CV, for those who
care and a portfolio of the projects that interest me most. As time goes on I
may develop the site further, perhaps include a blog to track some of the most
interesting projects I undertake which will likely include hardware and software 
builds for midi controllers, various software-centric music projects with a 
heavy emphasis on Max for Live devices, my experiences with Tidal and Max 8,
and my ongoing study of the Supercollider environment and programming language.
